# GrowthModeling
The GrowthModeling repository contains a model to estimate business growth. The model was developed by Group 2 (Cohort 20024) as part of the Professional Certificate Program in Product Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Using the Logistic Growth equation and a density-dependent decline term as the foundation (also known as the Allee Effects equation), our Team has developed a system of seven differential equations that allow us to model multiple business-specific and topology-specific metrics such as the number of computing units based on processing requirements, computing cost, storage cost, archive cost, number of storage data IO operations, number of archive data IO operations, storage data IO operations cost, archive data IO operations cost, infrastructure cost, total carbon footprint, carbon footprint by infrastructure tier, gross revenue, net revenue, and cost per platform user, among other metrics. In addition, our model has 34 different coefficients that can be adjusted to perform various business growth experiments, including defining multiple rate plans and modeling those simultaneously to analyze profitability under different growth rates. The Team is currently analysing results derived using 3.5 million users as the carrying capacity (K), an initial pool of 1000 customers (N), a 7% intrinsic growth rate (r), a 2% intrinsic decline rate (d), and a time projection of 15 years. We also modeled a Premium, Standard, and Basic plan with costs of $75.00, $35.00, and $15.00, respectively.
